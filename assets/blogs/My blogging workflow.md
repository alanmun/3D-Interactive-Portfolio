I made this to document how I figured out a blogging setup in case its valuable to others and also to learn if there are even better ways of blogging.

My goals was to create as streamlined a workflow as possible. I wanted it to be as hassle-free as possible so that it would encourage me to write more. Lower the activation energy and catalyze the reactions, you know what I mean.

### My current setup
I already do almost all my writings now inside of Obsidian in my vault.
