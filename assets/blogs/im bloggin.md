I was reading Gary Newman's [*How do I get into the Game industry*](https://garry.net/posts/how-do-i-get-into-the-game-industry) blog post earlier today and enjoyed it very much.  I'll highlight one part at the end, where one of the things he said stuck with me:

> I can't speak from other companies, but I can tell you what I look at when we get an application.  
  >
>You should really see it from my point of view. You want me to pay you? What can you do for me?  
  >
>So when you're applying for a job, are you treating it like an apprenticeship? Are you expecting the employer to train you up and show you what to do? Or are you telling them, I can do this for you, I can take this weight, I can make this better?  
  >
>If I google your name, am I going to find 8 years of you being an arsehole and endlessly crusading on Twitter? Or will I find 8 years of you being excited and inquisitive about what you're doing?  
>
> Are you going to make my life harder or easier?

Specifically:
>If I google your name, am I going to find 8 years of you being an arsehole and endlessly crusading on Twitter? Or will I find 8 years of you being excited and inquisitive about what you're doing? 

And that got me thinking- it's great that I don't have 8 years of being a whiny goober on xitter, but on the other hand I also don't know if I have the 8 years of evidence to show that I'm the hardworking and passionate developer that I know I am, apart from a decently lived-in GitHub account.

For quite some time now its dawned on me that maintaining a presence on the internet is a valuable thing to do that will pay back in many ways- not just for career advancement but for life enrichment, too. Just opening up opportunities to connect with other cool people that I align with and all that jazz.

On top of that, my boss at work has asked me numerous times to start writing my stuff down. I'm not sure if its because he sees genius in me or because he just wants me to stop yapping about random ideas I've had in MS Teams chats during work hours.

So... I've decided to start a blog! With the idea being that I can control the environment exactly as I want and move it where I want. I can pack up and move off of GitHub Pages if I ever need to, I can leave Obsidian (I currently write my blogs within Obsidian and ship them on the side as client-side rendered markdown, writing another blog about that soon), and I can link my blog anywhere else I'd want to build a presence, like twitter or linkedin.
