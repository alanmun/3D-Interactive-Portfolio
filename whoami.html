            Hello! I am a student currently at CMU earning a Master's in Software Engineering. I
            studied at the University of Pittsburgh and received a Bacherlor's of Science. I majored in Computer Science, while
            studying premedicine simultaneously and minored in Chemistry (as a consequence of studying premedicine jointly). I created this website as a learning experience initially to get more HTML/CSS practice but
            now I use it to track my skills and growth. The two big panes contain my
            resume and 3D portfolio. The small buttons link to this page and some other pages that may be of the
            interest, like my GitHub. The last small button links to a webpage I made to service users for my Twitter
            bot project.
