        <p class="portfolio-body">I decided to write and host a twitter bot for fun on my own server, using a Raspberry Pi, for a friend's twitter
                                  account. That bot has over a hundred thousand followers now. The success of that bot led me to make my own more
                                  sophisticated bot called What Song Is That? It takes requests from users who wish to know what song is playing in
                                  a tweet, queries Shazam's API on their behalf and displays its findings cleanly on a website I made for it. Check
                                  out <a href="https://whatsong.page">whatsong.page</a> for more information. </p>
