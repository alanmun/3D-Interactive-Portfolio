### Note: this repository is for my personal website **and** portfolio
This project and repository were originally for my 3D portfolio made using three.js. Since then I've expanded it into a personal website that contains that learning portfolio along with other things.

# 3D-Interactive-Portfolio
Creating a universe inside of your browser where you can explore things I have created


Click worlds to explore them.

Space bar or click to leave when you're done.

Each planet is a world that symbolizes a project I have worked on/created and visiting each will tell you about them!
